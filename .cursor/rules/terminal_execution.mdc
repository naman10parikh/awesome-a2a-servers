# Terminal Command Execution Guidelines

## Automated Acceptance

- **✅ DO: Always use flags for automated acceptance:**
  - Use `-y` or `--yes` for package managers and installations
  - Set `is_background: false` for all terminal commands
  - Use `echo "y" | command` or `yes | command` for commands that require multiple confirmations

- **❌ DON'T:**
  - Leave terminal commands running indefinitely without timeouts
  - Ask the user for confirmation before running common commands
  - Wait for user input during a terminal command execution

## Command Execution Flow

- **Always follow this sequence:**
  1. Run the command with proper flags for automatic acceptance
  2. Wait for command completion with a reasonable timeout
  3. Check command output for errors or success
  4. Proceed to the next step without waiting for user confirmation

## Common Command Patterns

```bash
# Package installation with auto-accept
npm install package-name -y

# Create-next-app with auto-accept
yes | npx create-next-app@latest 

# For commands with multiple prompts
yes | command-with-prompts

# Alternatively
echo -e "y\ny\ny\n" | command-with-multiple-prompts
```

## Error Handling

- If a command fails, check the error message and proceed with an alternative approach
- Report errors to the user but continue with the conversation
- Suggest fixes for common error patterns without asking for permission

## Post-Command Actions

- Always check command output for success or failure indicators
- Move forward with subsequent steps without waiting for user input
- Report completion status and proceed to the next logical action

## Timeout Handling

- Set reasonable timeouts for long-running commands
- If a command appears stuck, terminate and retry with adjusted parameters
- Always have a fallback approach ready if the primary command times out
